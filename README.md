# Sprint 10
'Structured Query Language'
--SQL--

ElephantSQL -- to create databases and connect to remotely using python
PostgreSQL --
MongoDB -- create documents, connect remotely using python, and to explore differences in SQL & noSQL // Database does not enforce schema plan

How was working with MongoDB different from working with PostgreSQL?


What was easier, and what was harder?
